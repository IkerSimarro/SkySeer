This narrative is fully informed by your roadmap and the projectâ€™s goal to apply Machine Learning to UAP and Anomaly Detection.
ðŸ“‘ SkySeer AI Pipeline: Project Genesis and Strategic Rationale
1. Executive Summary: The Strategic Mission
The SkySeer project is the direct result of a strategic decision to apply advanced Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML) and Time-Series Analysis to the field of atmospheric and space-based anomaly detection.
The projectâ€™s goal is to transcend the limitations of manual observation and noisy Computer Vision (CV) by creating a stable, autonomous data pipeline capable of:

Efficiently harvesting every genuine transient event from long-duration video archives.
Statistically filtering out 99% of common traffic (satellites, meteors, noise).
Flagging rare, anomalous events (potential UAPs) for high-priority human review.
This project directly addresses the Short-Term Goal (0â€“12 months) of your ML Roadmap: building a functional "Sky Anomaly Detector" suitable for integration with civilian aerospace research groups (like SCU or UAPx).
2. Phase I: The Technical Necessity and Project Pivot
The core challenge that led to the current design was the unreliable nature of initial Computer Vision methods when applied to low-light, low-cost equipment (like the RPi Camera Module NoIR).
The Failure of Heuristics and Visual Classification
Early iterations of the project attempted real-time visual classification using simple pixel rules (e.g., "if contour size > 5 pixels, it's a plane"). This strategy failed because:

Noise Amplification: Low-light amplification in the camera generates significant flicker and noise around bright objects (stationary stars), which the initial detector often flagged as real motion.
The Timelapse Trap: In your processed videos, the slow movement of stars across the frame was continuously detected as movement, generating a massive, unusable volume of false positive clips.
Classification Contamination: Due to noise, a faint satellite would be mislabeled as "Junk," while random sensor noise would trigger a "Meteor" flag.
This failure confirmed that visual analysis is too subjective and noisy for automated sorting. The project required a pivot from image processing to data processing.
3. Phase II: The Core Innovation â€” Non-Visual AI
The final SkySeer pipeline is built on the concept of Feature Engineeringâ€”turning visual evidence into abstract numerical "Flight Signatures."
A. Data Engineering (Feature Creation)
The Harvester (Stage 2) was redesigned to log key kinematic and geometric metrics for every moving object:
Metric (Feature)Strategic PurposeRationaleAverage Speed (Î¼s
â€‹)Differentiates object type based on velocity.High Î¼s
â€‹ is a meteor/fast satellite; Low Î¼s
â€‹ is stationary noise or slow traffic.Speed Consistency (Ïƒs
â€‹)Measures the stability of the movement path.Low Ïƒs
â€‹ (low standard deviation) indicates controlled, stable orbit (Satellite). High Ïƒs
â€‹ indicates erratic, uncontrolled movement (Noise, atmospheric influence, debris).Total DurationDistinguishes between short flashes and long transits.Essential filter for filtering out common brief camera glitches.

B. The Final Filter Layers
The subsequent stages use Unsupervised Learning (UML)â€”a perfect technique for anomaly hunting, as it doesn't require prior labeled examples of a UAP.

It identifies data points that are statistical outliersâ€”events whose speed, consistency, and duration do not fit any of the common clusters.Delivers a list of statistically unique events directly to the human expert.

4. Final Product and Portfolio Impact
The SkySeer AI Pipeline provides a complete, robust system ready for integration into a professional aerospace or scientific anomaly research setting.
Key Deliverables:
Sorted Output Folders: The final output is not raw video, but a structured directory (motion_clips/) with automatically labeled folders:
0_ANOMALY_UAP_REVIEW (Highest Priority): Contains clips flagged by the Isolation Forest as statistically rare.
1_METEOR_EVENT / 2_SATELLITE_ORBIT: Contains clips confirmed to follow predictable patterns.
3_PLANE_OR_JUNK: Contains clips flagged by K-Means as low-priority noise/common debris.
Demonstrated Skills: The project showcases competency in four critical areas for aerospace ML roles:
Data Engineering: Turning complex video into clean numerical features.
Time-Series Analysis: Calculating and leveraging movement statistics.
Unsupervised Learning: Using K-Means and Isolation Forest to manage high-volume, unlabeled data.
Robust Filtering: Designing systems that maintain high sensitivity while blocking intractable real-world noise.
