SkySeer Improvement Tasks:

Remove Star Category from UI (keep detection logic intact):

Remove "Stars" download button from results section
Remove star count metric from summary dashboard
Stars should still be detected internally to maintain accuracy for other objects
Do NOT remove star classification from the backend
Implement Smart Clip Trimming:

Trim each video clip to 1 second before object appears + 1 second after it disappears
Export only these trimmed clips (not the full sped-up video)
This should significantly reduce ZIP file size
Enhance Small Object Detection:

Improve detection sensitivity for small satellites that don't cross the entire screen
Better capture faint/small meteorites
Adjust contour detection and variance thresholds as needed
Add Color-Coded Detection Rectangles:

Green rectangles for satellites
Red rectangles for meteors
Keep existing colors for planes and other objects
Apply to saved video clips
Improve Plane Detection Algorithm:

Planes have blinking lights (usually red)
Detect the obvious on/off pattern in brightness
Use this flashing pattern as a key identifier for plane classification
Overall Accuracy Improvements:

Review and optimize classification thresholds
Reduce false positives while maintaining detection rate
Fine-tune ML clustering parameters if needed
Performance Optimization for Long Videos (1+ hour):

Optimize processing speed for videos longer than 1 hour
Reduce exported ZIP file size through better compression or clip trimming
Ensure timeout fixes work well with extended processing times
Confidence Threshold Filter in UI:

Add a slider in the results section to filter by minimum confidence level
Example: "Only show detections above 70% confidence"
Helps users quickly filter out uncertain detections
Detection Summary in ZIP File:

Include a text file (summary.txt) inside each ZIP download
List: what was detected, when, and confidence scores
Provides quick reference without opening the CSV
Export Preset Configurations:

Add ability to save/load detection settings for different scenarios
Include presets like: "Backyard Telescope", "Wide Angle", "High Altitude", "Meteor Shower"
Saves time for users with similar setups
Visual Detection Preview (optional):
Show thumbnail preview of detections with color-coded rectangles
Helps users quickly identify interesting clips before downloading
Duplicate Detection Prevention (optional):
If same object detected multiple times in close succession, merge into one clip
Reduces redundant clips in export
